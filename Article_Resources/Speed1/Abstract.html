  The exhaust system of a typical automobile includes a catalytic converter
  followed by a muffler. Internal combustion engines, commonly used by automobiles,
  are a source of both air and noise pollution. The catalytic converter and
  muffler address these problems. Each component is essential but requires
  considerable space in the vehicle, and both can create backpressure which
  reduces the engine’s efficiency. Miguel Santos’ “Silencer and Power Enhancement
  Environmental Device (SPEED)” patent is a device which functions both as
  a catalytic converter and a muffler. The initial design of this device
  was unsuccessful, therefore, improvements on his design and further research
  into the two devices were necessary. Alumina and stainless steel ATI 409HP
  are materials that, according to research, should better suit this device.
  The geometry was also modified, considering structural integrity while
  maintaining a succession of chambers with increasing cross sectional area.
  Inserting wash coated ceramic filters into the channels of this updated
  SPEED device promises adequate catalysis and conversion of exhaust materials.
  In the future, a prototype built with these conditions can be used to obtain
  quantitative data on its performance. Although this device may seem more
  convenient, it might not work as efficiently as current exhaust devices
  working in succession.
