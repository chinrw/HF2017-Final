Internal combustion engines (ICE) are devices in which combustion reaction occurs and some of the heat released from the reaction is converted to mechanical work, while the rest of the heat is considered as waste heat. Typically, fossil fuels are used but there are also vehicles which uses renewable energy. Different types of engines, in which combustion occurs irregularly are classified as ICEs and among them is a four-stroke piston engine, which is commonly used in automobiles. The four-stroke engines generally have a piston, intake valve, exhaust valve, spark plug for a spark ignition engine, and a cylinder. There are multiple essential parts of the engine structure, but focusing on the processes in the four-stroke cycle, the previously mentioned components are the most essential. Figure 1 shows the general structure of the four-stroke engines and processes in the four-stroke cycle. Top dead center (TDC) is the height along the cylinder closest to the valves, while bottom dead center (BDC) is the height farthest from the valves.

The four processes in the cycle are intake stroke, compression stroke, power stroke and exhaust stroke. Initially, the piston would be at the top, then the intake valve opens to allow a fuel-air mixture to enter the cylinder. Simultaneously, the piston moves down which increases the volume of the mixture. The compression stroke occurs when the valves are closed and the piston moves upwards. This increases the pressure and temperature of the mixture. Before the piston reaches TDC, the spark plug creates a spark which allows for combustion reaction to occur. The reaction produces a mixture of gases and leads to the power process. Due to the reaction, there is an increased pressure in the cylinder which pushes the piston down. As the piston goes down, the gases in the cylinder expands, thus, decreasing its temperature and pressure. Once the piston has reached the BDC, the exhaust valve opens. The exhaust stroke then occurs, with the piston moving up once again, expelling the gases out through the exhaust valve. The exhaust valve then closes once the piston reaches TDC and the cycle repeats.

Catalytic Converters
After the exhaust is expelled from the engine, it enters the exhaust system where it travels from the engine out into the environment. Along the way, it passes through a device called the catalytic converter usually about a third of the way from the engine to the tailpipe. The purpose of a catalytic converter is to reduce the concentrations of harmful emissions before the engine exhaust is expelled into the atmosphere. The main emissions of concern currently are Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and unburnt Hydrocarbons (HC). A perfect combustion (occurring at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio of 14.7:1 for gasoline engines) would produce only harmless CO2 and H2O but often due to how engines are used as well as varying environmental conditions, the air-fuel ratio will be either slightly lower (fuel-rich) or higher (fuel-lean). In general, when the engine is running rich, CO and HC ratios in the exhaust will be higher. NOx is caused by oxygen and nitrogen in the air reacting at high temperatures to bond together so it occurs even in fuel-rich operation but will occur in higher concentrations during fuel-lean operation. The exhaust also has a much higher concentration of oxygen when the engine is running lean.

In order to reduce the amount of harmful gases, the catalytic converter facilitates a couple of chemical reactions shown below, to change the harmful chemicals into harmless gases.

Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides: 2NOx → xO2 + N2
Oxidation of Carbon Monoxide: 2CO + O2 → 2CO2
Oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons: CxH2x+2 + [(3x+1)/2]O2 → xCO2 + (x+1)H2O

These reactions are generally facilitated by a catalyst so that they will happen at the temperature and environment of the converter. At a sufficiently high temperature (~1200F), the oxidation reactions will occur spontaneously, although slowly, and some devices known as thermal reactors have been developed to increase the temperature of the exhaust gas to the required temperature. However, the reduction of NOx will not occur spontaneously and because it is also a regulated emission (see Table 1), thermal reactors are not widespread.

Catalytic converters generally consist of a steel casing in which two separate ceramic honeycomb substrates are located. A wash coat containing catalysts and other materials is applied to the ceramic substrate. The nature of the wash coat as well as the honeycomb structure itself maximizes the surface area in contact with the exhaust in order to maximize the catalytic area available for reaction and thus increase the conversion rates of the harmful gases. The most common catalysts are Platinum, Palladium, and Rhodium. Platinum is the most effective but also the most expensive so most commercial converters use Palladium and Rhodium. These facilitate both the reduction and oxidation reactions. One solution that has been explored is using a thermal reactor with a catalyst that only facilitate the reduction of NOx, but the catalysts available that perform that reaction do not have the properties necessary (e.g. too much of them would be required, they would melt at the temperature of a thermal reactor, etc.). Also commonly included in the wash coat is cerium oxide which stores oxygen from the exhaust when the engine is running lean and releases it when the engine is running rich through reactions shown below. In some designs, outside air brought into the exhaust stream before the converter in order to increase the amount of oxygen available.

Reduction of Cerium (IV) Oxide under rich conditions (oxygen shortage)
2CeO2 + CO → Ce2O3 + CO2

Oxidation of Cerium (III) Oxide under lean conditions (oxygen surplus)
2Ce2O3 + O2 → 4CeO2

In addition to the reactions noted here and earlier, there are some other reactions that are occurring in the converter that achieve the same goals of eliminating harmful gases but the ones noted are the ones that happen the most. There are also some intermediate catalytic reactions that occur which enable the reduction reactions and speed up the oxidation reactions. In general these reactions consist of one or more of the reactants (Oxygen, NOx, and CO) adsorbing into the catalyst (reacting with it to form a new material). This new material reacts with either a reactant in the exhaust stream or another adsorbed reactant to desorb from the catalyst, having formed the product(s) of the reaction. For the oxidation reactions of HC and CO, the catalysts serve to lower the activation energy of the reaction to allow it to occur more rapidly and with greater frequency at the operating temperature of a catalytic converter (on average 800F to 1200F). For the reduction of NOx, the catalysts serve to allow the reaction to occur and also speed it up. In general for the reactions in a converter, the rate of reaction (and therefore the amount of unwanted gases converted) increases with increasing temperature.

Mufflers
After the exhaust gases have passed through the second honeycomb block and exits the catalytic converter, it goes through a pipe connected to the muffler. A muffler is a device that is designed to reduce the noises emitted by the exhaust of an internal combustion engine. Without a muffler, certain sound waves generated by the engine or the exhaust system would flow through the system and out the tailpipe, emitting into the surrounding environment. Most mufflers employ acoustic quieting techniques such as destructive interference and friction in order to cancel out these traveling waves. Moreover, the large pressure variation between forcefully exiting fumes and ambient air at the outlet of an exhaust system causes rapid expansion of the effluence, with a potentially loud and periodic “pop.” Most mufflers function to reduce the pressure of the exhaust flowing through it, thereby lessening this pressure differential and the sound produced by effluence as it exits (“Exhaust Systems”). By destroying traveling sound waves and reducing pressure, mufflers silence a majority of the noises that an engine exhaust system would otherwise emit. One common issue with mufflers is back pressure, a phenomenon where certain resistances over-dampen or obstruct the flow of an exhaust system and affect engine performance.
